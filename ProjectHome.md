# Introduction #
**GridMe** is an interactive development environment (IDE) for simulating behavior of complex distributed computing systems or [Grids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing). **GridMe** is implemented in Java on top of the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) platform. The system can simulate various entities: brokers, users, task flows, clusters, nodes, data servers, network connections, etc. You can watch a [screencast](http://gridme.googlecode.com/svn/site/tutorial.avi) to see the basic usage of GridMe.

  * GridMe is scalable, it can simulate Grid models containing thousands of processors and millions of tasks
  * GridMe is configurable - it can be used to model different Grid resource management architectures. Supports custom pluggable elements (written in Java)
  * The system includes tools for visualization of simulation results
  * Includes analyzer and editor for workload archives

# Tools used #
  1. Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
  1. OpenArchitectureWare (OAW) tools
  1. JFreeChart library (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart)
